## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Before Purchase:
```
📦 Unlimited Cards
   Remove the limit on the number of cards you can create
                                    $0.99
   [Purchase] ← Button active
```

### 2. After Purchase:
```
📦 Unlimited Cards ✅
   Remove the limit on the number of cards you can create
                                 [Purchased]
   [Already Purchased] ← Button replaced
```

### 3. In "Purchased Products" section:
```
✅ com.dor.flippin.unlimited_cards
```

## 💻 Programmatic Usage

### Checking Product Status:
```swift
let unlimitedCardsId = "com.dor.flippin.unlimited_cards"

if PurchaseService.shared.isProductPurchased(unlimitedCardsId) {
    print("✅ Unlimited Cards is purchased")
    // Show premium features
} else {
    print("❌ Unlimited Cards is not purchased")
    // Show limited features
}
```

### Getting All Purchased Products:
```swift
let purchasedProducts = PurchaseService.shared.getPurchasedProducts()
print("📦 Purchased: \(purchasedProducts)")
// Output: ["com.dor.flippin.unlimited_cards"]
```

### Reacting to Purchase in Code:
```swift
// In your app
if PurchaseService.shared.isProductPurchased("com.dor.flippin.unlimited_cards") {
    // Remove limit on number of cards
    cardLimit = .max
} else {
    // Set limit
    cardLimit = 10
}
```

## 🎨 UI Changes

### ProductRowView:
- **Unpurchased product**: Shows price and "Purchase" button
- **Purchased product**: Shows "Purchased" and "Already Purchased"

### PurchaseTestView:
- **New section**: "Purchased Products" with list of purchased products
